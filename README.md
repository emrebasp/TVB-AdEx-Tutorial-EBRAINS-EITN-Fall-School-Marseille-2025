# TVB-AdEx-Tutorial-EBRAINS-EITN-Fall-School-Marseille-2025

## What can I find here?
This repository contains the materials which are used during the hands-on session on 24 November 2025, during EITN Autumn School 2025, which takes place in Marseille: https://www.ebrains.eu/news-and-events/eitn-ebrains-fall-school-2025.

The objective of this hands-on session is to create a familiarity with mean-field concepts for the participant by performing simulations related to different brain states. We will see the AdEx mean-field model and its building blocks. We will see example simulations of this mean-field framework in relation to neural population dynamics in different brain states. Finally, we will show a generalization of this framework to the whole-brain scale via TVB.

## Requirements
Once downloaded, the participants are suggested to run the cells with the title "Initialization" in "mainAdEx.ipynb" (Part I) and in "Human_TVB_AdEx.ipynb" (Part II) to see and install the necessary packages/dependencies. If the notebooks are run locally, then "%matplotlib widget" should be disabled by commenting it in the relevant cells.
